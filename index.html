        Zelda: Breath of the wild: Zelda BOTW is a Nintendo switch game that
        came out on March/3/2017 & is the first complete open world zelda game.

        been able to offer.

        P.V.Z: PVZ is the first game of a long and enjoyable franchise that is
        adored by many & among one of the first games i ever played. PVZ is a
        tower defense style game where u defend Crazy Daves house with a variety
        of plants against a number of unigue(ish) Zombies. It released
        May/5/2009

      <li>
        P.V.Z 2: PVZ 2 is the sequel to PVZ 1 where u now travel through time to
        collect plants and fight zombies & Zomboss in various ways. Along with
        the game being longer with numerous worlds to collect plants in it also
        offers more game modes than the previous one. PVZ 2 also still gets
        frequent updates as PVZ 3 is still in the works. PVZ 2 released
        Aug/15/2013

        P.V.Z Garden Warfare: PVZ GW takes a spin on the tower defense game and
        turns it into a first person shooter. With this being the PVZ where
        plants and zombies fought it put a unique spin on first person shooters.
        The game was released Feb/25/2014

        P.V.Z Garden Warfare 2: This is the PvZ game ive spent most of the time
        on out of all of PvZ games. With each of the 7 classes having elemental
        variations,various abilities,& 2 secrect characters. This game i still
        havent completed as there is a numerous amount of stuff to do. My
        favorite character on plants is Electro Pea. & on Zombies Drake IMP.
        This game released Feb/23/2016

        P.V.Z Battle for neighborville: PvZ BFN is the last PvZ game to be
        released and this game somewhat flopped compared to the previous PvZ GW
        games. With GW 2 being a large and well known game in the gaming
        community everyone expected BFN to be just as good or even better. Sadly
        this was not the case as character variants were not in the game and
        even with the story it felt somewhat dull. This led many people to go
        back to GW 2 and BFN slowly died over time as the developers (Popcap)
        laft it after only 1 year. My fav character on Plants is
        Snapdragon/Nightcap and for Zombies Space Cadet. BFN released
        Spet/4/2019 but was fully released Oct/18/2019

        Halloween is a favorite holiday of mine filled with horror
        movies,costumes,frightful huanted mansions,& more. My Halloween costume
        for this year is basically just a psychotic grim reaper.
